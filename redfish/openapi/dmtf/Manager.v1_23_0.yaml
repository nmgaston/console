      description: In Redfish, a manager is a systems management entity that can implement
        or provide access to a Redfish service.  Examples of managers are BMCs (baseboard
        management controllers), enclosure managers, management controllers, and other
        subsystems that are assigned manageability functions.  An implementation can
        have multiple managers, which might be directly accessible through a Redfish-defined
        interface.

      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        AuxiliaryController: A controller that provides management functions for a
          particular subsystem or group of devices as part of a larger system.
        BMC: A controller that provides management functions for one or more computer
          systems.  Commonly known as a BMC (baseboard management controller).  Examples
          of this include a BMC dedicated to one system or a multi-host manager providing
          BMC capabilities to multiple systems.
        EnclosureManager: A controller that provides management functions for a chassis,
          group of devices, or group of systems with their own BMCs (baseboard management
          controllers).  An example of this is a manager that aggregates and orchestrates
          management functions across multiple BMCs in an enclosure.
        FabricManager: A controller that primarily monitors or manages the operation
          of a group of fabric attached nodes and switches.
        ManagementController: A controller that primarily monitors or manages the
          operation of a device or system.
        RackManager: A controller that provides management functions for a whole or
          part of a rack.  An example of this is a manager that aggregates and orchestrates
          management functions across multiple managers, such as enclosure managers
          and BMCs (baseboard management controllers), in a rack.
        Service: A software-based service that provides management functions.
