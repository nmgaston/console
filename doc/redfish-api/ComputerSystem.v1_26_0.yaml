      x-enumDescriptions:
        Composed: A computer system constructed by binding resource blocks together.
        DPU: A computer system that performs the functions of a data processing unit,
          such as a SmartNIC.
        OS: An operating system instance.
        Physical: A computer system.
        PhysicallyPartitioned: A hardware-based partition of a computer system.

        VirtuallyPartitioned: A virtual or software-based partition of a computer
          system.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        Composed: A `SystemType` of `Composed` typically represents a single system
          constructed from disaggregated resources through the Redfish composition
          service.
        DPU: A `SystemType` of `DPU` typically represents a single system that performs
          offload computation as a data processing unit, such as a SmartNIC.
        OS: A `SystemType` of `OS` typically represents an OS or hypervisor view of
          the system.
        Physical: A `SystemType` of `Physical` typically represents the hardware aspects
          of a system, such as a management controller.
        PhysicallyPartitioned: A `SystemType` of `PhysicallyPartitioned` typically
          represents a single system constructed from one or more physical systems
          through a firmware or hardware-based service.
        Virtual: A `SystemType` of `Virtual` typically represents a system that is
          actually a virtual machine instance.  Responses should contain the `ProcessorSummary`
          and `MemorySummary` properties to show the processor and memory resources
          allocated to the virtual machine.
        VirtuallyPartitioned: A `SystemType` of `VirtuallyPartitioned` typically represents
          a single system constructed from one or more virtual systems through a software-based
          service.
