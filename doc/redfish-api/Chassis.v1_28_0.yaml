      description: The `Chassis` schema represents the physical components of a system.  This
        resource represents the sheet-metal confined spaces and logical zones such
        as racks, enclosures, chassis and all other containers.  Subsystems, such
        as sensors, that operate outside of a system's data plane are linked either
        directly or indirectly through this resource.  A subsystem that operates outside
        of a system's data plane are not accessible to software that runs on the system.  It
        also describes the location, such as a slot, socket, or bay, where a unit
        can be installed, by populating a resource instance with an absent state if
        a unit is not present.

        Component: A small chassis, card, or device that contains devices for a particular
          subsystem or function.
        Drawer: An enclosed or semi-enclosed, typically horizontally-oriented, system
          chassis that can be slid into a multi-system chassis.

          its capabilities or capacity.
        Sled: An enclosed or semi-enclosed, system chassis that must be plugged into
          a multi-system chassis to function normally similar to a blade type chassis.
        StandAlone: A single, free-standing system, commonly called a tower or desktop
          chassis.
        StorageEnclosure: A chassis that encloses storage.
        Zone: A logical division or portion of a physical chassis that contains multiple
