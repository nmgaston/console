      description: The `ComputerSystem` schema represents a computer or system instance
        and the software-visible resources, or items within the data plane, such as
        memory, CPU, and other devices that it can access.  Details of those resources
        or subsystems are also linked through this resource.

          nullable: true
          readOnly: true
          type: string
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain a value that represents the
            manufacturer of the system.
        Model:
          description: The product name for this system, without the manufacturer
            name.
          nullable: true
          readOnly: true
          type: string
          x-longDescription: This property shall describe how the manufacturer refers
            to this system.  Typically, this value is the product name for this system
            without the manufacturer name.
        Name:

          readOnly: true
        PowerState:
          description: The current power state of the system.
          oneOf:
          - $ref: Resource.yaml#/components/schemas/Resource_PowerState
          - enum:
            - null
          readOnly: true
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the power state of the system.
        SerialNumber:
          description: The serial number for this system.
          nullable: true
          readOnly: true
          type: string
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the serial number for the
            system.
        UUID:
          description: The UUID for this system.
          oneOf:
          - $ref: Resource.yaml#/components/schemas/Resource_UUID
          - enum:
            - null
          readOnly: true
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the universally unique identifier
            number for this system.  RFC4122 describes methods to create this value.  The
            value should be considered to be opaque.  Client software should only
            treat the overall value as a UUID and should not interpret any subfields
            within the UUID.  If the system supports SMBIOS, the property value should
            follow the SMBIOS 2.6 and later recommendation for converting the SMBIOS
            16-byte UUID structure into the Redfish canonical `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
            string format, so that the property value matches the byte order presented
            by current OS APIs, such as WMI and dmidecode.  For additional property
            requirements, see the corresponding definition in the Redfish Data Model
            Specification.
        HostName:
          description: The DNS host name, without any domain information.
          nullable: true
          readOnly: false
          type: string
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the host name for this system,
            as reported by the operating system or hypervisor.  A service running
            in the host operating system typically reports this value to the manager.  Modifying
            this property may modify the `HostName` in one or more `EthernetInterface`
            resources contained in this system.
        BiosVersion:
          description: The version of the system BIOS or primary system firmware.
          nullable: true
          readOnly: true
          type: string
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the version string of the
            currently installed and running BIOS for x86 systems.  For other systems,
            the property may contain a version string that represents the primary
            system firmware.
        Status:

          $ref: Resource.yaml#/components/schemas/Resource_Oem
          description: The OEM extension property.
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the OEM extensions.  All
            values for properties that this object contains shall conform to the Redfish
            Specification-described requirements.

      properties:
        ResetType:
          $ref: Resource.yaml#/components/schemas/Resource_ResetType
          description: The type of reset. GracefulShutdown and GracefulRestart map to IPS_PowerManagementService.RequestOSPowerSavingStateChange.
          x-longDescription: This parameter shall contain the type of reset. For Intel
            AMT systems, GracefulShutdown and GracefulRestart values map to
            IPS_PowerManagementService.RequestOSPowerSavingStateChange method. The
            service can accept a request without the parameter and perform an implementation-specific
            default reset. Services should include the `@Redfish.AllowableValues`
            annotation for this parameter to ensure compatibility with clients, even
            when `ActionInfo` has been implemented.
      type: object
      x-longDescription: This action shall reset the system represented by the resource.  For
        systems that implement ACPI Power Button functionality, the `PushPowerButton`
        value shall perform or emulate an ACPI Power Button Push, and the `ForceOff`
        value shall perform an ACPI Power Button Override, commonly known as a four-second
        hold of the power button.
