          nullable: true
          readOnly: true
          type: string
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain a human-readable string to

            same enclosure, which may include hierarchical information of containing
            `PartLocation` values for the part.  The value of this property shall
            not include values of the `PartLocation` properties for the part itself.  The
            purpose of this value, in conjunction with the `PartLocation` of the part
            itself, is to allow clients to determine the physical location of the
            part without tracing through the `PartLocation` of multiple resources.

          x-longDescription: This property shall contain a physical address for a
            resource.  This property should be present for resources that represent
            physical objects that can operate without requiring physical containment
            by another resource.  For example, a server chassis might be contained
            by a rack, but it might also be deployed individually, while a drive is
            always contained by a chassis and therefore is described by the containing
            resource.

      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        ForceOff: Turn off the unit immediately (non-graceful shutdown).
        ForceOn: Turn on the unit immediately.
        ForceRestart: Shut down immediately and non-gracefully and restart the unit.
        FullPowerCycle: Full power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful).  Behaves
          like removing utility lines, followed by restoring utility lines to the
          resource.
        GracefulRestart: Shut down gracefully and restart the unit.
        GracefulShutdown: Shut down gracefully and power off.
        Nmi: Generate a diagnostic interrupt, which is usually an NMI on x86 systems,
          to stop normal operations, complete diagnostic actions, and, typically,
          halt the system.
        'On': Turn on the unit.
        Pause: Pause execution on the unit but do not remove power.  This is typically
          a feature of virtual machine hypervisors.
        PowerCycle: Power cycle the unit immediately (non-graceful).  Behaves like
          a power removal, followed by a power restore to the resource.
        PushPowerButton: Simulate the pressing of the physical power button on this
          unit.
        Resume: Resume execution on the paused unit.  This is typically a feature
          of virtual machine hypervisors.
        Suspend: Write the state of the unit to disk before powering off.  This allows
          for the state to be restored when powered back on.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        ForceOff: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power
          off state.  The transition will start immediately.  Upon successful completion,
          the `PowerState` property, if supported, shall contain the value `Off`.
        ForceOn: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power
          on state.  The transition will start immediately.  Upon successful completion,
          the `PowerState` property shall contain the value `On`.
        ForceRestart: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a
          power on state, after transiting through a restart.  The transition will
          start immediately.  Upon successful completion, the `PowerState` property,
          if supported, shall contain the value `On`.
        FullPowerCycle: This value shall indicate the resource will perform a full
          power cycle as if utility lines to the resource are removed and restored.  The
          transition will start immediately.  This is different from `PowerCycle`
          in that it's as close to a true power cycle as possible.  For example, removing
          AC power cables from an enclosure and then restoring the AC power cables.  If
          currently in the power on state, the resource will transition to a power
          off state, then transition to a power on state.  If currently in the power
          off state, the resource will transition to a power on state.  Upon successful
          completion, the `PowerState` property, if supported, shall contain the value
          `On`.  If a service supports this value but there are no other distinct
          power cycle flows, the service shall support `PowerCycle` as an alias to
          `FullPowerCycle`.  This type of reset may cause the manager providing the
          Redfish service to power cycle.  If the manager providing the Redfish service
          is affected by this type of reset, the service shall send the action response
          before resetting to prevent client timeouts.
        GracefulRestart: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to
          a power on state, after transiting through a restart.  The transition will
          start after first performing tasks to safely shut down the resource.  For
          example, when shutting down a computer system, the host operating system
          is allowed to safely shut down processes and close connections.  Upon successful
          completion, the `PowerState` property, if supported, shall contain the value
          `On`.
        GracefulShutdown: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to
          a power off state.  The transition will start after first performing tasks
          to safely shut down the resource.  For example, when shutting down a computer
          system, the host operating system is allowed to safely shut down processes
          and close connections.  Upon successful completion, the `PowerState` property,
          if supported, shall contain the value `Off`.
        Nmi: This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
        'On': This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on
          state.  Upon successful completion, the `PowerState` property, if supported,
          shall contain the value `On`.
        Pause: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a paused
          state.  Upon successful completion, the `PowerState` property, if supported,
          shall contain the value `Paused`.
        PowerCycle: This value shall indicate the resource will perform a power cycle.  The
          transition will start immediately.  This is different from `FullPowerCycle`
          in that it typically performs localized power sequencing of the resource
          while external power is still present.  For example, turning DC voltage
          regulators off and then turning DC voltage regulators back on.  If currently
          in the power on state, the resource will transition to a power off state,
          then transition to a power on state.  If currently in the power off state,
          the resource will transition to a power on state.  Upon successful completion,
          the `PowerState` property, if supported, shall contain the value `On`.
        PushPowerButton: This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if
          the physical power button is pressed.  The behavior of pressing the physical
          power button may be dependent on the state of the unit and the behavior
          may be configurable.
        Resume: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power
          on state.  Upon successful completion, the `PowerState` property, if supported,
          shall contain the value `On`.
        Suspend: This value shall indicate the resource will have any state information
          written to persistent memory and then transition to a power off state.  Upon
          successful completion, the `PowerState` property, if supported, shall contain
          the value `Off`.

        AuxiliaryController: A controller that provides management functions for a
          particular subsystem or group of devices as part of a larger system.
        BMC: A controller that provides management functions for one or more computer
          systems.  Commonly known as a BMC (baseboard management controller).  Examples
          of this include a BMC dedicated to one system or a multi-host manager providing
          BMC capabilities to multiple systems.
        EnclosureManager: A controller that provides management functions for a chassis,
          group of devices, or group of systems with their own BMCs (baseboard management
          controllers).  An example of this is a manager that aggregates and orchestrates
          management functions across multiple BMCs in an enclosure.
        FabricManager: A controller that primarily monitors or manages the operation
          of a group of fabric attached nodes and switches.
        ManagementController: A controller that primarily monitors or manages the
          operation of a device or system.
        RackManager: A controller that provides management functions for a whole or
          part of a rack.  An example of this is a manager that aggregates and orchestrates
          management functions across multiple managers, such as enclosure managers
          and BMCs (baseboard management controllers), in a rack.
        Service: A software-based service that provides management functions.
